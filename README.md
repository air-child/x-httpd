The code in this plugin was written in 2005, it's a mixture of C and C++.

A lot of work is required to make this into safer software that wont suffer from simple
buffer overflow attacks.

I have open sourced the project in the hope that we can create a stable core plugin for
others to use to extend their products onto other devices like tablets and phones.
